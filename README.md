# Etsy Code Exercise

Build a fresh take on the classic sliding puzzle game. You can do this in
whatever language you like but make sure it is presented on some sort of
modern UI platform (i.e. web, android, iOS).

# Solution Outline

Minimum Requirements:

1. Present a solvable puzzle to the end user. Ensure that the user does not
see a puzzle combination that can't be solved.

2. Add a hint button that tells the user the next best step if they get stuck.

3. If the user decides to give up, there should be a way for them to see the
sequence of moves needed to solve the puzzle.

4. Detect when the puzzle is solved and notify the user in some way.

Additional Possible Features:

1. Allow the user to select between a few different puzzle sizes (3x3, 4x4, etc)

2. Animate tiles when moving.

3. Keep track of the number of moves used to solve a puzzle.

4. Keep track of those scores per user, create high score board (persist how
you like).

5. Use famous images (paintings, pictures, public figures) as the tiles instead
of just numbers.

6. Anything else you can think of.
